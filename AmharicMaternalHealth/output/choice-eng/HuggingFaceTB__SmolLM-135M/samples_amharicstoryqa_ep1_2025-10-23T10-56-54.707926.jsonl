One night he dreamed he was giving a divorce to his beautiful wife. When he woke up he was shocked that he saw this dream. Because he loved his wife very much, he decided not to tell her about the dream. Instead, he went to the Qadi [Islamic judge] for his advice. He said, “I dreamed I was giving my beloved wife a divorce. I want to know if my wife will bring me good luck or bad luck and what shall I do about it? We have no quarrels between us.” But the Qadi had in mind to have the wife for himself since she was very beautiful. So the Qadi said, “My son, this dream is very true. So you have to give her a divorce and give her compensation.” But Abu Nawas was not satisfied by the Qadi’s answer and doubted his motives and suspected him and left his house. Meanwhile the Qadi thought of some means to get rid of Abu Nawas and went to the Amir. After the greetings he said, “I have come to deliver a message from my dreams to you. I dreamed about your dead parents and I told them about your health and your way of life.” Then the Amir was very happy and sad to hear about his dead parents. The Qadi said, “I have a message from your father. He asks me to tell you to send him a thick cloak (gabi) through a very trustworthy person. I need it right away.” The Amir started to search in his mind for the right person but he couldn’t find one, so the Qadi said, “My Lord, I know a trustworthy person, also a fast person. There is no other person than Abu Nawas. He is the only one that could deliver the cloak to your father.” The Amir agreed with the proposition. So then Abu Nawas was called and brought to the Amir. The humble Abu Nawas without knowing that a plot was being hatched against him, came to the palace. When he was brought to the Amir, the Amir said, “Abu Nawas. Listen very carefully. The reason I brought you here is because the Qadi told me that in his dream he saw my father telling him to tell me that he is in dire need of a cloak and to send him one as soon as possible through a trustworthy person. So you are chosen to do this job because you are the only trustworthy person that I know of. So I want you to tell me when you want to be buried so that I can prepare the cloak.” Abu Nawas knew at once that this was a plot directed against him by the Qadi. Immediately he thought of a way out of the plot and agreed with the plan. But he asked one favour from the Amir. He said, “ I want to be buried beside my father’s grave.” The reason for this was he wanted to say goodbye to his relatives and friends. “If you promise this for me I will promise to obey your orders.” The Amir agreed. Then Abu Nawas went back to his room and started to put his plan into practice. He dug his grave himself and put a mark on it. Then he started to dig a tunnel so he could escape after he is buried. This he did in a few weeks. At the end of the fourth week the Qadi, who was eager to see Abu Nawas buried alive, arrived at the palace before anyone else was there. The Amir with his advisors and counsellors entered the throne room. Immediately after that, Abu Nawas entered and sat down. Silence fell and the Qadi was sitting quietly but he was eager to listen to what Abu Nawas would say without showing it. Then Abu Nawas stood up and addressed the Amir. He said he had come to fulfil the Amir’s wishes and he was ready to do that without showing any kind of fear. Then the Amir gave him the cloak and asked him if he has anything to say – his last words. Abu Nawas pointed to where the mark of his grave was and said goodbye to the observers. So they dressed him in a shroud and together with the cloak he was buried in the grave he dug himself. After he was buried, Abu Nawas went out through the tunnel and went to another village and started to live there as another person, changing his face, personality and everything. After a few weeks he went to the city where the Amir was residing. When he went to the Amir’s house, the Amir saw him and stood up, surprised, and invited him to come in and sit down. After the greetings he told him about his mission. He said, “I have found both your parents and I told them that I was sent by their son, the Amir, to give them this cloak. And I gave it to your father. Your father was very happy and sends his blessing. Your mother looks very old, but your father still looks young. I have been with them for one week, and when I was going to leave them, your father asked me to deliver a message to you. The message is, 'Your mother is becoming very old. I want to get married with another woman. So my son, I want you to send me a qadi who will bless our marriage immediately.'” The Amir was very happy about the condition of his father and sent for the Qadi to come quickly. Then the Qadi, when he heard that he was wanted by the Amir, went immediately to the palace. The Amir said to him, “My father has sent me a message through Abu Nawas that he wants to get married again. So I want you to go there immediately and do the marriage according to Sharia law.” When the Qadi heard this he was shocked and sat stunned. The Qadi had no means of getting out of this situation, and just blinked his eyes, confused. He did not know what to say. After a while the Amir said, “Give me an answer. I want an answer.” The Qadi came back to life and said, “I want to go home and say goodbye to my family this night and I will come back early in the morning. So he rushed home and spent the night fidgeting and he could not think how to extricate himself. So he gave up. Then he thought, “If I refuse to fulfil the Amir’s wishes I will be dead anyway, by execution in public, so it’s better if I go willingly and give myself up to the Amir.” So he went to the Amir’s house. When he arrived there, he looked at the Amir with desperation, and sunken eyes and a drawn face and told the Amir he was ready to obey his wishes. So then he was dressed in a shroud and buried alive just as he wanted to be done to Abu Nawas. The theme is: the grave that he dug for his brother, he was put in himself.

I dreamed about your dead parents and I told them about your health and your way of life.” Then the Amir was very happy and sad to hear about his dead parents. The Qadi said, “I have a message from your father. He asks me to tell you to send him a thick cloak (gabi) through a very trustworthy person. I need it right away.” The Amir started to search in his mind for the right person but he couldn’t find one, so the Qadi said, “My Lord, I know a trustworthy person, also a fast person. There is no other person than Abu Nawas. He is the only one that could deliver the cloak to your father.” The Amir agreed with the proposition. So then Abu Nawas was called and brought to the Amir. The humble Abu Nawas without knowing that a plot was being hatched against him, came to the palace. When he was brought to the Amir, the Amir said, “Abu Nawas. Listen very carefully. The reason I brought you here is because the Qadi told me that in his dream he saw my father telling him to tell me that he is in dire need of a cloak and to send him one as soon as possible through a trustworthy person. So you are chosen to do this job because you are the only trustworthy person that I know of. So I want you to tell me when you want to be buried so that I can prepare the cloak.” Abu Nawas knew at once that this was a plot directed against him by the Qadi. Immediately he thought of a way out of the plot and agreed with the plan. But he asked one favour from the Amir. He said, “ I want to be buried beside my father’s grave.” The reason for this was he wanted to say goodbye to his relatives and friends. “If you promise this for me I will promise to obey your orders.” The Amir agreed. Then Abu Nawas went back to his room and started to put his plan into practice. He dug his grave himself and put a mark on it. Then he started to dig a tunnel so he could escape after he is buried. This he did in a few weeks. At the end of the fourth week the Qadi, who was eager to see Abu Nawas buried alive, arrived at the palace before anyone else was there. The Amir with his advisors and counsellors entered the throne room. Immediately after that, Abu Nawas entered and sat down. Silence fell and the Qadi was sitting quietly but he was eager to listen to what Abu Nawas would say without showing it. Then Abu Nawas stood up and addressed the Amir. He said he had come to fulfil the Amir’s wishes and he was ready to do that without showing any kind of fear. Then the Amir gave him the cloak and asked him if he has anything to say – his last words. Abu Nawas pointed to where the mark of his grave was and said goodbye to the observers. So they dressed him in a shroud and together with the cloak he was buried in the grave he dug himself. After he was buried, Abu Nawas went out through the tunnel and went to another village and started to live there as another person, changing his face, personality and everything. After a few weeks he went to the city where the Amir was residing. When he went to the Amir’s house, the Amir saw him and stood up, surprised, and invited him to come in and sit down. After the greetings he told him about his mission. He said, “I have found both your parents and I told them that I was sent by their son, the Amir, to give them this cloak. And I gave it to your father. Your father was very happy and sends his blessing. Your mother looks very old, but your father still looks young. I have been with them for one week, and when I was going to leave them, your father asked me to deliver a message to you. The message is, 'Your mother is becoming very old. I want to get married with another woman. So my son, I want you to send me a qadi who will bless our marriage immediately.'” The Amir was very happy about the condition of his father and sent for the Qadi to come quickly. Then the Qadi, when he heard that he was wanted by the Amir, went immediately to the palace. The Amir said to him, “My father has sent me a message through Abu Nawas that he wants to get married again. So I want you to go there immediately and do the marriage according to Sharia law.” When the Qadi heard this he was shocked and sat stunned. The Qadi had no means of getting out of this situation, and just blinked his eyes, confused. He did not know what to say. After a while the Amir said, “Give me an answer. I want an answer.” The Qadi came back to life and said, “I want to go home and say goodbye to my family this night and I will come back early in the morning. So he rushed home and spent the night fidgeting and he could not think how to extricate himself. So he gave up. Then he thought, “If I refuse to fulfil the Amir’s wishes I will be dead anyway, by execution in public, so it’s better if I go willingly and give myself up to the Amir.” So he went to the Amir’s house. When he arrived there, he looked at the Amir with desperation, and sunken eyes and a drawn face and told the Amir he was ready to obey his wishes. So then he was dressed in a shroud and buried alive just as he wanted to be done to Abu Nawas. The theme is: the grave that he dug for his brother, he was put in himself. And Abu Nawas and his wife lived happily ever after.\"\n\n                Question:\n                \"What is the central theme or lesson presented at the end of the story?\"\n\n                Choices:\n                A) Those who plot evil for others may fall into their own traps.\n                B) The Amir alone has the power to determine people's fate.\n                C) It is important to ask for advice from religious leaders.\n                D) Dreams always come true and must be acted upon.\n\n                Your answer (A, B, C, or D):", "arg_1": " B"}, "gen_args_2": {"arg_0": "Read the following story carefully and answer the question that follows.\n\n                Story:\n                \"Narrated by Yusuf Omar Osman In the times of the Amirs in Harar there was a wise man called Abu Nawas.

He said, “I dreamed I was giving my beloved wife a divorce. I want to know if my wife will bring me good luck or bad luck and what shall I do about it?

She had four brothers. When they reached puberty, the age of marriage, they wanted to marry a girl as beautiful as their sister. The couldn’t find any beautiful girls like her. So the three brothers said to one another, “Why should we marry ugly girls who are not as beautiful as our sister?” Finally they decided and said to the eldest brother, “You marry her.” The eldest brother was about to marry her. The fourth son was crippled. He loved his sister and she loved him. When the girl went out to fetch water with her pot, the three older brothers and mother plotted. They decided that, when she comes, fetching water, through the door, the older brother will put out his leg and hold her up, so that she can’t enter. She will say, 'Why, brother, don’t you put down your legs and let me come in?’ He would say, ‘I am not your brother, I’m your husband.’ Brothers two and three would do the same. She will ask the same question, ‘Brother, why don’t you let me in?’ Two and three would answer, ‘I’m not your brother. I am your brother-in-law.’ The mother will put out her leg and say, ‘I’m not your mother, I’m your mother-in-law.’ So they do this again and again. The fourth brother puts his legs down for her. He’s not a collaborator. One day the crippled brother says, “My Adiberga, please carry me and take me out to the toilet.” She took him. When she takes him out and puts him down, he says, “This is a field where tef [an Ethioian food grain] grows. I will not use it as a toilet.” After that she takes him to a further place, a sorghum field. “I can’t do it here, to make the sorghum dirty.” After she took him far away. “Put me here, my Adiberga. It’s not because I couldn’t get a place to use as a toilet that I told you to carry me. It is because I have smelled the problem that you have.” “Therefore, what is the problem?” she asks him. “There is a problem in the family and that’s why they are tripping you up.” “What is the problem?” He tells her they want to marry her and he advises her to run away. She runs away. She sits on a tree near the edge of a river in a deserted place, where she can’t see any people. She lives there. Now a certain maidservant of a rich man comes to the river to fetch water. When she tries to collect water in the pot, she sees the reflection of a very beautiful girl. She thinks, “Is it me?” The maid says, “Why should I fetch water since I have such a beautiful face?” She broke her pot and went home. Then she changed her mind, afraid that her master would be angry, and went back to the river again with another pot. She saw the same image. Again she said the same thing and broke her pot. Adiberga spat on her from the tree. The maid looked up and saw her. She ran and told her master, “Master, I saw a very beautiful girl, as charming as St. Mary.” He didn’t believe her, so he went with her and saw Adiberga. He admired her beauty. This wealthy man brought two carpets and spread them beneath the tree. In the middle of the carpets he plunges a spear into the ground – the sharp side upwards. He says, “If you have come with complaints or bad deeds, if you’re running away since you’ve done something bad, or no complaints or grievances from your home, if you have run away, you will fall down on the spear. But if you have come here because you have been badly treated at home like a slave and you’re a good girl, you will fall down on the carpet.” So she came down on the carpet. He married her. The crippled brother, not knowing where she was, travelling and asking for his sister, came to her house. She’s very rich now. This Adiberga, being the wife of a very rich man, doesn’t come out of the house, because she has many servants. When the crippled brother reaches the gate, he shakes a tree. “Who is this man? See who he is,” she ordered her maids. The maids say, “A man who looks like you.” She says, “I don’t have any relatives. Who could it be? The only brother I have is crippled. Please go and check.” Another maid goes to check. She gets the same answer. “He’s just like you – his teeth, his eyes and so on.” “Let me see who he is. Bring carpets.” She walks on them and goes to see him. It’s her brother. They kissed each other. She said, “Come in,” and took him into the house. “Now my husband is not at home, but he is a wise man. When he tells you to herd cattle, kill them. When he says kill them, look after them. This is his way of ordering. You must do the opposite. When he tells you to take the cattle to a desert where there is no water, take them to the river and have them drink water.” So when the husband came, he met his wife's brother. The husband said as she advised. The wealthy man took a leather sack and put into it the shaved hair of a sheep, a goat, an ox, a cow and a horse and gives him that and says, “Take this and go back to where you came from. When you reach your village, beat the sack with a stick.” He gave him a certain magic kind of stick. When the brother did as the wealthy man said, out came dozens of oxen, cows, goats, sheep, horses and mules and he went home very wealthy. People wondered. His brothers asked him, “Where did all these animals come from?” They were surprised. He replied, “Our sister, I hunted for her and her husband gave me all this.” So the oldest wanted to go and get the same reward, like the crippled one did. When he arrived at Adiberga's house, the maids looked at him. “This other man also looks like you,\" they told their mistress. “Which other relatives do I have?” she says bitterly. Again they went and told her the same thing. She said, “Go again and look.” The same thing. Finally she went out and it was that evil man. She spat on him. She took him inside. She didn’t give him any advice like she did with the crippled brother. The wealthy man comes. He told him the same thing – take the animals to the desert and kill them. Then he shaved off the hair of the lion, the elephant, the hyena and the ghosh-bear and gave him a stick and said, “Beat it,” and he did and dozens of wild animals came out of the sack and ate him up.", "question": "Why did the three oldest brothers want to marry Adiberga?", "question_amh": "ሦስቱ ታላላቅ ወንድሞች አዲበርጋን ማግባት ለምን ፈለጉ?", "question_score": 0.7578095794, "A": "Because they could not find another girl as beautiful as their sister.", "A_amh": "ምክንያቱም እንደ እህታቸው ሌላ ቆንጆ ልጅ ማግኘት አልቻሉም።", "A_score": 0.7331839204, "B": "Because it was tradition for siblings to marry each other.", "B_amh": "ምክንያቱም ወንድሞችና እኅቶች እርስ በርሳቸው ማግባታቸው የተለመደ ነበር።", "B_score": 0.7410283685, "C": "Because their mother forced them to do so.", "C_amh": "ምክንያቱም እናታቸው አስገድዳቸዋለች።", "C_score": 0.7389994264, "D": "Because she was the richest girl in the village.", "D_amh": "ምክንያቱም እሷ በመንደሩ ውስጥ በጣም ሀብታም ልጅ ነበረች.", "D_score": 0.7723369002, "avarage quality": 0.748671639, "generated_answer": "A", "region": "benishangul-gumuz", "link": "https://www.ethiopianfolktales.com//en/benishangul-gumuz/84-the-story-of-adiberga", "question_id": 1, "choice_A_amh": "ምክንያቱም ወንድሞችና እኅቶች እርስ በርሳቸው ማግባታቸው የተለመደ ነበር።", "choice_A_eng": "Because it was tradition for siblings to marry each other.", "choice_A_original_role": "Common-Sense Distractor", "choice_B_amh": "ምክንያቱም እሷ በመንደሩ ውስጥ በጣም ሀብታም ልጅ ነበረች.", "choice_B_eng": "Because she was the richest girl in the village.", "choice_B_original_role": "Factual Contradiction", "choice_C_amh": "ምክንያቱም እናታቸው አስገድዳቸዋለች።", "choice_C_eng": "Because their mother forced them to do so.", "choice_C_original_role": "Unrelated Hallucination", "choice_D_amh": "ምክንያቱም እንደ እህታቸው ሌላ ቆንጆ ልጅ ማግኘት አልቻሉም።", "choice_D_eng": "Because they could not find another girl as beautiful as their sister.", "choice_D_original_role": "Correct Answer", "answer": "D"}, "target": "3", "arguments": {"gen_args_0": {"arg_0": "Read the following story carefully and answer the question that follows.\n\n                Story:\n                \"Narrated by Demelew Beyene Once there was a beautiful girl called Adiberga.

Bring carpets.” She walks on them and goes to see him. It’s her brother. They kissed each other. She said, “Come in,” and took him into the house. “Now my husband is not at home, but he is a wise man. When he tells you to herd cattle, kill them. When he says kill them, look after them. This is his way of ordering. You must do the opposite. When he tells you to take the cattle to a desert where there is no water, take them to the river and have them drink water.” So when the husband came, he met his wife's brother. The husband said as she advised. The wealthy man took a leather sack and put into it the shaved hair of a sheep, a goat, an ox, a cow and a horse and gives him that and says, “Take this and go back to where you came from. When you reach your village, beat the sack with a stick.” He gave him a certain magic kind of stick. When the brother did as the wealthy man said, out came dozens of oxen, cows, goats, sheep, horses and mules and he went home very wealthy. People wondered. His brothers asked him, “Where did all these animals come from?” They were surprised. He replied, “Our sister, I hunted for her and her husband gave me all this.” So the oldest wanted to go and get the same reward, like the crippled one did. When he arrived at Adiberga's house, the maids looked at him. “This other man also looks like you,\" they told their mistress. “Which other relatives do I have?” she says bitterly. Again they went and told her the same thing. She said, “Go again and look.” The same thing. Finally she went out and it was that evil man. She spat on him. She took him inside. She didn’t give him any advice like she did with the crippled brother. The wealthy man comes. He told him the same thing – take the animals to the desert and kill them. Then he shaved off the hair of the lion, the elephant, the hyena and the ghosh-bear and gave him a stick and said, “Beat it,” and he did and dozens of wild animals came out of the sack and ate him up.\"\n\n                Question:\n                \"Why did the three oldest brothers want to marry Adiberga?\"\n\n                Choices:\n                A) Because it was tradition for siblings to marry each other.\n                B) Because she was the richest girl in the village.\n                C) Because their mother forced them to do so.\n                D) Because they could not find another girl as beautiful as their sister.\n\n                Your answer (A, B, C, or D):", "arg_1": " A"}, "gen_args_1": {"arg_0": "Read the following story carefully and answer the question that follows.\n\n                Story:\n                \"Narrated by Demelew Beyene Once there was a beautiful girl called Adiberga. She had four brothers. When they reached puberty, the age of marriage, they wanted to marry a girl as beautiful as their sister. The couldn’t find any beautiful girls like her. So the three brothers said to one another, “Why should we marry ugly girls who are not as beautiful as our sister?” Finally they decided and said to the eldest brother, “You marry her.” The eldest brother was about to marry her. The fourth son was crippled. He loved his sister and she loved him. When the girl went out to fetch water with her pot, the three older brothers and mother plotted. They decided that, when she comes, fetching water, through the door, the older brother will put out his leg and hold her up, so that she can’t enter. She will say, 'Why, brother, don’t you put down your legs and let me come in?’ He would say, ‘I am not your brother, I’m your husband.’ Brothers two and three would do the same. She will ask the same question, ‘Brother, why don’t you let me in?’ Two and three would answer, ‘I’m not your brother. I am your brother-in-law.’ The mother will put out her leg and say, ‘I’m not your mother, I’m your mother-in-law.’ So they do this again and again. The fourth brother puts his legs down for her. He’s not a collaborator. One day the crippled brother says, “My Adiberga, please carry me and take me out to the toilet.” She took him. When she takes him out and puts him down, he says, “This is a field where tef [an Ethioian food grain] grows. I will not use it as a toilet.” After that she takes him to a further place, a sorghum field. “I can’t do it here, to make the sorghum dirty.” After she took him far away. “Put me here, my Adiberga. It’s not because I couldn’t get a place to use as a toilet that I told you to carry me. It is because I have smelled the problem that you have.” “Therefore, what is the problem?” she asks him. “There is a problem in the family and that’s why they are tripping you up.” “What is the problem?” He tells her they want to marry her and he advises her to run away. She runs away. She sits on a tree near the edge of a river in a deserted place, where she can’t see any people. She lives there. Now a certain maidservant of a rich man comes to the river to fetch water. When she tries to collect water in the pot, she sees the reflection of a very beautiful girl. She thinks, “Is it me?” The maid says, “Why should I fetch water since I have such a beautiful face?” She broke her pot and went home. Then she changed her mind, afraid that her master would be angry, and went back to the river again with another pot. She saw the same image. Again she said the same thing and broke her pot. Adiberga spat on her from the tree. The maid looked up and saw her. She ran and told her master, “Master, I saw a very beautiful girl, as charming as St. Mary.” He didn’t believe her, so he went with her and saw Adiberga. He admired her beauty. This wealthy man brought two carpets and spread them beneath the tree. In the middle of the carpets he plunges a spear into the ground – the sharp side upwards. He says, “If you have come with complaints or bad deeds, if you’re running away since you’ve done something bad, or no complaints or grievances from your home, if you have run away, you will fall down on the spear. But if you have come here because you have been badly treated at home like a slave and you’re a good girl, you will fall down on the carpet.” So she came down on the carpet. He married her. The crippled brother, not knowing where she was, travelling and asking for his sister, came to her house. She’s very rich now. This Adiberga, being the wife of a very rich man, doesn’t come out of the house, because she has many servants. When the crippled brother reaches the gate, he shakes a tree. “Who is this man? See who he is,” she ordered her maids. The maids say, “A man who looks like you.” She says, “I don’t have any relatives. Who could it be? The only brother I have is crippled. Please go and check.” Another maid goes to check. She gets the same answer. “He’s just like you – his teeth, his eyes and so on.” “Let me see who he is.
